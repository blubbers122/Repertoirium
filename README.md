# Repertoirium

A simple repertoir organizer web app built using bootstrap, flask and javascript. Data was retrieved from the Deezer API. Allows you to search for songs and store them in your repertoire. The drag and drop UI lets you quickly move songs from lists. You can track your tempo for a song and send messages on the chat page too. All of the user's data is stored in a database to persist after logging out.
